### ✨ Dashboard Preview

Here's a glimpse of the dashboard in action. Watch how the data responds to different filters and selections!

<!-- 
  **BEST PRACTICE:** Record a short GIF of you clicking through the filters and charts.
  It's much more impressive than a static image! You can use a free tool like ScreenToGif or Giphy Capture.
  Then, upload the GIF to your GitHub repository and link it here.

### 🧐 About The Project

This project was developed to transform raw road accident statistics into a powerful visual tool. Traditional spreadsheets and reports can be overwhelming and fail to reveal hidden patterns. This dashboard addresses that problem by providing a user-friendly interface to:

-   Visualize accident hotspots geographically.
-   Understand the relationship between accident severity, weather conditions, and time of day.
-   Analyze trends over months, days of the week, and years.
-   Empower decision-makers with data-driven evidence for targeted safety interventions.

### ⭐ Key Features

-   **📈 KPI Cards:** At-a-glance metrics for total casualties, accidents, and severity trends (e.g., YoY growth).
-   **🔍 Interactive Filters:** Dynamically filter the entire dashboard by:
    -   Accident Severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
    -   Weather Conditions
    -   Road Type
    -   Year and Month
-   **🗺️ Geospatial Map:** (If applicable) An interactive map highlighting accident locations, with density clusters.
-   **📊 Insightful Charts:**
    -   **Casualties by Vehicle Type:** Identify which vehicles are most commonly involved.
    -   **Accidents by Road Surface:** Analyze the impact of road conditions.
    -   **Monthly & Weekly Trends:** Discover peak accident times.
